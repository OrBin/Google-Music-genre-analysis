This is a little tool to analyze the genres in a Google Music collection. I made it for a class project.

It depends on [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API).

To use it, just run:
```
python genres.py download
python genres.py analyze
```

There's a blog post on what I found about my own library [on my blog](http://www.simonmweber.com/2012/09/07/whats-in-a-genre.html).
